# Projects included:

- **Basic Calculator** : A simple calculator built using the tkinter library. It currently supports basic arithmetic operations but does not handle complex calculations yet.

- **Sudoku Solver**: A backtracking-based algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles.

- **Pong Game** : A basic implementation of the classic Pong game using the turtle library. The ball speed increases as the score goes up.

I plan to expand this repository with more beginner-friendly projects over time.
